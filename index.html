<h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
        <p>The mission of creating this site is to create a website with a broad view on a certain consoles history.</p>
        <p>A lot of websites that cover retro games tend to usually be filled with tons of paragraphs of information.</p>
        <p>Yes, it's important to cover the whole history; however, sometimes it's nice to see just the main keypoints without digging through paragraphs and paragraphs of information to find what you're looking for.</p>

    <h2>Three Goals:</h2>
        <p>First off, I want to discuss the overview and broad history of Nintendo home consoles.</p>
        <p>Secondly, it's very important to cover these past consoles, because of the legacy and impact each piece of hardware has left in the gaming industry.</p>
        <p>Lastly, knowing who created it and when these consoles came to tuition is a very important piece on the success of a console in the market.</p>

    <h2>Site Inspiration:</h2>
    <a href="http://www.vgmuseum.com/"><img src="images/mueseum.PNG" alt="VGMueseum" width="250" height="250" /></a>
        <p>The site, "VGMueseum" is very important towards the creation of my website.</p>
        <p>The reason for VGMueseum's inspiration is mainly, because of the connection and love towards retro games.</p>
        <p>As mentioned before, the site VGMueseum covers a wide variety of retro game facts and media; however, we decided to take the direction of only going through some of Nintendo's past consoles.</p>
        <p>The layout of VGMueseum will have a lot of connections to the organization and layout of my site, with the exception of my site covering the past Nintendo consoles.</p>

    <h2>Content:</h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, this website will cover a brief history on the NES,SNES, and Nintendo 64.</p>
        <p>In a general perspective, this site will cover the launch date of the console, first and last game released, best and worst selling game and original retail price.</p>
        <p>Also, there will be a section on each page that covers everything; but, in the other well-known regions such as, Japan and the PAL region(Europe and Australia).</p>
    
    <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
        <p>This website will target the gamers or people who love all sorts of video games.</p>
        <p>When it's all said and done, my site can appeal to anyone, because of how gaming has became so mainstream.</p>
